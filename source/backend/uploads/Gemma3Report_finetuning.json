This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation"

We release all our models to the community. 1. Introduction We present the newest version of Gemma open language models (Gemma Team, 2024a), co- designed with the family of Gemini frontier mod- els (Gemini Team, 2023).

This version comes with several new abilities to the Gemma family; namely, multimodality, long context, and mul- tilinguality, while preserving or surpassing the performance of prior versions. In terms of multimodality, most Gemma 3 mod- els are compatible with a tailored version of the SigLIP vision encoder (Zhai et al., 2023). The language models treat images as a sequence of soft tokens encoded by SigLIP. We reduce the in- ference cost of image processing by condensing the vision embeddings into a fixed size of"

The second main architectural improvement is an increase in context size to 128K tokens, with- out reducing performance. A challenge with long context is the memory explosion of the KV cache during inference. To reduce this issue, we inter- leave multiple local layers between each global layer, and assign a smaller span of only 1024 tokens to the local layers. Therefore, only the global layers attend to long context, and"

All Gemma 3 models are trained with knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015).

Discussion and Conclusion In this work, we have presented Gemma 3, the latest addition to the Gemma family of open lan- guage models for text, image, and code. In this version, we focus on adding image understanding and long context while improving multilinguality and STEM-related abilities. Our model sizes and architectures are designed to be compatible with standard hardware, and most of our architecture improvements are tailored to fit this hardware while maintaining performance.
